# Backwriter

Backwriter is a Rust Core and Runtime for current, structural text work over
admitted Workspace Source. It provides target-local File, Paragraph, and Line
addresses without turning source history or editor state into Core identity.

The Core capability inventory is Search, View, Pick, Anchor, Check, Edit,
Apply, and Data. The repository currently provides their Rust Core/Runtime
surfaces and the canonical `backwriter` executable's one-shot human Search
mode.

## Quick start

```arduino
cargo build --release
backwriter search line "needle"
backwriter --workspace /path/project search paragraph "needle"
```

The default workspace is the process current working directory. An explicit
`--workspace` must be absolute and is checked by Runtime. Search admits `.` by
default; repeat `--admit LOGICAL_PATH` before `search` to narrow admission.
After the query, repeat `--source LOGICAL_PATH` or `--subtree LOGICAL_PATH` to
narrow a Search scope. Without a scope selector, Search covers all admitted
sources.

## Current CLI scope

`backwriter` currently implements only one-shot human Search:

```text
backwriter [--workspace ABSOLUTE_PATH] [--admit LOGICAL_PATH]...
    search <line|paragraph|file> <query>
    [--source LOGICAL_PATH | --subtree LOGICAL_PATH]...
```

The CLI preserves Core Search validation and deterministic result order. It
does not expose raw Anddress values or workspace coordinates in human output.
CLI Session, shell grammar, View, Pick, Check, Anchor, Edit, Apply, Data, JSON,
and raw output remain deferred.

## Scope

Backwriter is not Git, a file watcher, daemon, persistent index, or editor UI.
It reads admitted current Workspace Source through Runtime's safe no-follow
access. It does not model branches, merges, history, automatic re-evaluation,
or editor buffers.

## Build and test

```sh
cargo build --offline --locked --release
cargo test --offline --locked
```
